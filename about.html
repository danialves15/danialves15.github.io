    <h3>Who am I?</h3>
    <p>
        My name is Daniela Alves Mendes
        and I am a student in ESAD.CR 
        <br>Before getting in this school I studied Sciences
        which ended up making
        <br>my first steps in art pretty hard.
        
        <br>
        
        <br>Now I am in my last year of college and one day you'll see my name on the credits at the end of a <strong>Pixar movie</strong>
       
        <br>
       
        <br>Here is a quote from my favourite singer, Harry Styles:

<blockquote cite="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/678527-a-dream-is-only-a-dream-until-you-decide-to">
    <em>A dream is only a dreamâ€¦ until you decide to make it real.</em>
</blockquote>
